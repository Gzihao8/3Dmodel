# 3Dmodel
A software platform that can generally process 3D model files, including mouse click extraction information and mouse click free drawing function

- Background

3D reconstruction focuses on reconstructing 3D scene based on image information, but it lacks further application to the obtained 3D scene. On the basis of 3D reconstruction, this software platform visualizes the reconstructed results and provides the function of interactive application. Users can extract the desired information from the visualized model. At the same time, the space trajectory curve can be drawn freely on the surface of the model.
